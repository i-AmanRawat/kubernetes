# Fix the Limits: Reducing Memory Usage

To avoid consuming too much of your machine’s resources or having a constantly crashing pod, let's reduce the memory usage of the `testram` pod to a safer value.

## Step 1: Update the `MEGABYTES` Environment Variable

To fix the issue, we’ll update the **`MEGABYTES`** environment variable in the **ConfigMap** to **10 MB**. This will allocate significantly less memory to the application, preventing crashes.

1. Update the **ConfigMap** to set `MEGABYTES` to `10`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: synergychat-testram-configmap
data:
  MEGABYTES: "10"
```
````

2. Apply the updated ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl apply -f testram-configmap.yaml
```

## Step 2: Delete the Pod

To apply the new environment variable, we need to delete the existing pod. Kubernetes will automatically recreate the pod using the updated ConfigMap.

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l app=synergychat-testram
```

This will cause the pod to be recreated with the updated memory configuration.

## Step 3: Verify the Pod Health

Once the pod is recreated, verify that it is healthy and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Check the pod’s status to ensure it's in the **Running** state and not in a crash loop.

## Step 4: Monitor Memory Usage

Next, check the memory usage of the pod to confirm that it’s using less than **10 MB** of memory.

```bash
kubectl top pod
```

The output should show that the pod is using significantly less than **10 MB** of memory, as specified by the `MEGABYTES` environment variable.

## Conclusion

By reducing the **MEGABYTES** environment variable to `10`, we’ve ensured that the `testram` pod uses a safe amount of memory and avoids exceeding resource limits. You can now continue testing without the pod crashing or consuming excessive resources.

```

### Key Changes:
- Clear step-by-step instructions on how to fix the memory usage issue.
- Added code snippets for updating the **ConfigMap**, deleting the pod, and checking the pod’s health.
- Emphasized monitoring the pod’s memory usage to ensure it stays within the specified limits.

This Markdown structure ensures that the task is easy to follow and can be completed without overwhelming the system's resources.
